**EchoHero** is an open-source platform created for the Gemini API Developer Competition. It helps users:

- ðŸš¨ Report local issues
- ðŸ’¡ Solve them
- ðŸŽ¯ Earn points and access rewards

The idea explores having an AI act as the moderator of this platform, reducing the manual workload of maintaing such an ecosystem.

The app is a proof-of-concept designed to enhance city living by fostering a self-sustainable community. Developed in a short time during the hackathon. ðŸš€
